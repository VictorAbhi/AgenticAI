# PCI Query Flow with LangGraph

This project implements a **LangGraph workflow** that simulates a Predictive Customer Intelligence (PCI) pipeline. It captures customer queries, segments them based on intent, and generates personalized suggestions while maintaining context across conversations using memory.

## üîç Features

- **LangGraph with 3 processing nodes**
  - **Node 1:** Captures user query + retrieves memory context
  - **Node 2:** Applies mock customer segmentation logic
  - **Node 3:** Returns suggestions based on customer segment
- **Memory persistence** using `ConversationBufferMemory`
- **Mock Predictive Customer Intelligence logic**
- Written in **Python** and supports both **Jupyter Notebook** and standalone script execution

## üöÄ How It Works

1. **User Query Input**  
   A customer query is passed to the workflow (e.g., "I want to buy a product" or "I have an urgent issue").

2. **Context Retrieval**  
   Memory stores and retrieves previous interactions using `ConversationBufferMemory`.

3. **Customer Segmentation**  
   Mock logic segments customers as:
   - `High-Priority Customer` (e.g., queries with "urgent" or "problem")
   - `Potential Buyer` (e.g., queries with "buy" or "purchase")
   - `General Inquirer` (all other queries)

4. **Suggestion Generation**  
   Based on the segment, the system returns an appropriate response, such as offering support escalation or product discounts.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running `task2.ipynb`)
- Required packages:
  - `langchain`
  - `langgraph`
  - `pydantic`

## Setup Instructions

### Quick Start
1. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install langchain langgraph pydantic
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   Or open `task2.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.

## Running the Application
- **Script Mode**: Run `python app.py` to start the interactive chatbot. Enter queries and type `exit` to quit.
- **Notebook Mode**: Open `task2.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook and execute the cells to explore the workflow interactively.

## Example Usage
```
PCI Query Flow Chatbot
Type 'exit' to quit.

üîπ Enter your query: I have an urgent issue
Context:
User Query: I have an urgent issue
Segment: High-Priority Customer
Suggestion: Offer immediate support ticket escalation.
```

## Future Work
- Integrate a large language model (LLM) for advanced segmentation and suggestion generation.
- Add support for external data sources to enhance PCI logic.
- Implement a graphical user interface for better user interaction.
